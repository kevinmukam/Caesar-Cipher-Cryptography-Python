# Caesar-Cipher-Cryptography-Python
As part of my Network Security class, one of the tasks required was to code the Caesar cipher encryption/decryption algorithms on Python. 
The Caesar cipher involves replacing each letter of the alphabet with the letter standing three places further down the alphabet. 

plain: meet me after the party 
cipher: PHHW PH DIWHU WKH SDUWB

Note that the alphabet is wrapped around, so that the letter following Z is A.

The transformation is: 
plain: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 
cipher: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C
